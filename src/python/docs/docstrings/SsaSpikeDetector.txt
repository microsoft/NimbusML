    This transform detects the spikes in a seasonal time-series using
    Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA).

    .. remarks::
        `Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_spectrum_analysis>`_ is a
        powerful
        framework for decomposing the time-series into trend, seasonality and
        noise components as well as forecasting
        the future values of the time-series. In order to remove the effect
        of such components on anomaly detection,
        this transform adds SSA as a time-series modeler component in the
        detection pipeline.

        The SSA component will be trained and it predicts the next expected
        value on the time-series under normal condition; this expected value
        is
        further used to calculate the amount of deviation from the normal
        (predicted) behavior at that timestamp.
        The distribution of this deviation is then modeled using `Adaptive
        kernel density estimation
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_kernel_density_estimation>`_.

        The `p-value <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value`_> score for the
        current deviation is calculated based on the
        estimated distribution. The lower its value, the more likely the
        current point is an outlier.

    :param training_window_size: The number of points, N, from the beginning
        of the sequence used to train the SSA
        model.

    :param seasonal_window_size: An upper bound, L,  on the largest relevant
        seasonality in the input time-series, which
        also determines the order of the autoregression of SSA. It must
        satisfy 2 < L < N/2.

    :param side: The argument that determines whether to detect positive or
        negative anomalies, or both. Available
        options are {``Positive``, ``Negative``, ``TwoSided``}.

    :param error_function: The function used to compute the error between the
        expected and the observed value. Possible
        values are {``SignedDifference``, ``AbsoluteDifference``,
        ``SignedProportion``, ``AbsoluteProportion``,
        ``SquaredDifference``}.
