    Extracts NGrams from text and converts them to vector using hashing
    trick.

    .. remarks::
        The ``NGramFeaturizer`` transform produces a bag of counts of
        sequences of consecutive words, called n-grams, from a given corpus
        of text.
        There are two ways it can do this:

        * build a dictionary of n-grams and use the id in the dictionary as
        the index in the bag;
        * hash each n-gram and use the hash value as the index in the bag.

        This class provide the text extractor that implement the second. In
        :py:class:`NGramFeaturizer
        <nimbusml.feature_extraction.text.NGramFeaturizer>`,
        users should specify which text extractor to use as the argument.

	    The purpose of hashing is to convert variable-length text documents
        into equal-length numeric feature vectors, to support
        dimensionality reduction and to make the lookup of feature weights
        faster.

        The n-grams are represented as count vectors, with vector slots
        corresponding to their hashes. Embedding ngrams in 
	    a vector space allows their contents to be compared in an efficient
        manner.
        The slot values in the vector can be weighted by the following
        factors:

        * *term frequency* - The number of occurrences of the slot in the
        text
        * *inverse document frequency* - A ratio (the logarithm of
          inverse relative slot frequency) that measures the information a
        slot
          provides by determining how common or rare it is across the entire
        text.
        * *term frequency-inverse document frequency* - the product
          term frequency and the inverse document frequency.
