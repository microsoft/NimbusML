    Entropy-Based Discretization

    .. remarks::
        In linear classification algorithms instances are viewed as vectors
        in
        multi-dimensional space. Since the range of values of raw data varies
        widely, some objective functions do not work properly without
        normalization. For example, if one of the features has a broad range
        of
        values, the distances between points is governed by this particular
        feature. Therefore, the range of all features should be normalized so
        that each feature contributes approximately proportionately to the
        final
        distance. This can provide significant speedup and accuracy benefits.
        In
        all the linear algorithms in nimbusml (:py:class:`Logistic Regression
        <nimbusml.linear_model.LogisticRegressionClassifier>`,
        :py:class:`Averaged Perceptron
        <nimbusml.linear_model.AveragedPerceptronBinaryClassifier>`,
        :py:class:`LinearDSVM <nimbusml.svm.LocalDeepSvmBinaryClassifier>`
        etc.),
        the default is to normalize features before training.

        ``SupervisedBinner`` implements the `Entropy-Based Discretization
        <http://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-019.pdf>`_.
        Partition of the data is performed recursively to select the split
        with highest entropy gain with respect to the label.
        Therefore, the final binned features will have high correlation with
        the label.


    :param columns: a dictionary of key-value pairs, where key is the output
        column name and value is the input column name.

        * Multiple key-value pairs are allowed.
        * Input column type: numeric or
         `Vector Type </nimbusml/concepts/types#vectortype-column>`_.
        * Output column type: numeric or
         `Vector Type </nimbusml/concepts/types#vectortype-column>`_.
        * If the output column names are same as the input column names, then
        simply specify ``columns`` as a list of strings.

        The << operator can be used to set this value (see
        `Column Operator </nimbusml/concepts/columns>`_)

        For example
         * SupervisedBinner(columns={'out1':'input1', 'out2':'input2'})
         * SupervisedBinner() << {'out1':'input1', 'out2':'input2'}

        For more details see `Columns </nimbusml/concepts/columns>`_.
