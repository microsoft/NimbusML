    Machine Learning One Class Support Vector Machines

    .. remarks::
        One-class SVM is an algorithm for anomaly detection. The goal of
        anomaly
        detection is to identify outliers that do not belong to some target
        class.
        This type of SVM is one-class because the training set contains only
        examples from the target class. It infers what properties are normal
        for
        the objects in the target class and from these properties predicts
        which examples are unlike the normal examples. This is useful for
        anomaly
        detection because the scarcity of training examples is the defining
        character of anomalies: typically there are very few examples of
        network
        intrusion, fraud, or other types of anomalous behavior.

    :param kernel: A character string representing the kernel used for
        computing
        inner products. The
        following choices are available:

        * :py:class:`rbf_kernel <nimbusml.svm.kernel.RbfKernel>`: Radial basis
        function kernel. It's parameter
          represents``gamma`` in the term ``exp(-gamma|x-y|^2``. If not
          specified, it defaults to ``1`` divided by the number of features
          used. For example, ``rbf_kernel(gamma = .1)``. This is the default
          value.
        * :py:class:`linear_kernel <nimbusml.svm.kernel.LinearKernel>`: Linear
        kernel.
        * :py:class:`polynomial_kernel <nimbusml.svm.kernel.PolynomialKernel>`:
          Polynomial kernel with parameter names ``a``, ``bias``, and ``deg``
        in
          the term ``(a*<x,y> + bias)^deg``. The ``bias``, defaults to ``0``.
          The degree, ``deg``, defaults to ``3``. If ``a`` is not specified,
        it
          is set to ``1`` divided by the number of features.
        * :py:class:`sigmoid_kernel  <nimbusml.svm.kernel.SigmoidKernel>`:
          Sigmoid kernel with parameter names
          ``gamma`` and ``coef0`` in the term ``tanh(gamma*<x,y> + coef0)``.
          ``gamma``, defaults to to ``1`` divided by the number of features.
        The
          parameter ``coef0`` defaults to ``0``.  For example,
          ``sigmoid_kernel(gamma = .1, coef0 = 0)``.

    :param epsilon: The threshold for optimizer convergence. If the
        improvement between iterations is less than the threshold, the
        algorithm
        stops and returns the current model. The value must be greater than
        or equal
        to ``numpy.finfo(double).eps``. The default value is 0.001.
    :param nu: The trade-off between the fraction of outliers and the number
        of
        support vectors (represented by the Greek letter nu). Must be between
        0 and
        1, typically between 0.1 and 0.5. The default value is 0.1.
    :param shrink: Uses the shrinking heuristic if ``True``. In this case,
        some samples will be "shrunk" during the training procedure, which
        may speed
        up training. The default value is ``True``.
    :param normalize: Specifies the type of automatic normalization used:

        * ``"Auto"``: if normalization is needed, it is performed
          automatically. This is the default choice.
        * ``"No"``: no normalization is performed.
        * ``"Yes"``: normalization is performed.
        * ``"Warn"``: if normalization is needed, a warning
          message is displayed, but normalization is not performed.

        Normalization rescales disparate data ranges to a standard scale.
        Feature
        scaling insures the distances between data points are proportional
        and
        enables various optimization methods such as gradient descent to
        converge
        much faster. If normalization is performed, a ``MaxMin`` normalizer
        is
        used. It normalizes values in an interval [a, b] where ``-1 <= a <=
        0``
        and ``0 <= b <= 1`` and ``b - a = 1``. This normalizer preserves
        sparsity by mapping zero to zero.

    .. note::

        This algorithm is single-threaded and will always attempt to load the
        entire dataset into memory.
