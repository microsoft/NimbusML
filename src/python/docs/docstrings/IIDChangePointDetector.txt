    This transform detects the change-points in an i.i.d. sequence using
    adaptive kernel density estimation and martingales.

    .. remarks::
        ``IIDChangePointDetector`` assumes a sequence of data points that are
        independently sampled from one
        stationary distribution. `Adaptive kernel density estimation
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_kernel_density_estimation>`_
        is used to model the distribution.

        This transform detects
        change points by calculating the martingale score for the sliding
        window based on the estimated distribution.
        The idea is based on the `Exchangeability
        Martingales <https://icml.cc/Conferences/2012/papers/808.pdf>`_ that
        detects a change of distribution over a stream of i.i.d. values. In
        short, the value of the
        martingale score starts increasing significantly when a sequence of
        small p-values are detected in a row; this
        indicates the change of the distribution of the underlying data
        generation process.

    :param confidence: The confidence for change point detection in the range
        [0, 100]. Used to set the threshold of the martingale score for
        triggering alert.

    :param change_history_length: The length of the sliding window on p-value
        for computing the martingale score.

    :param martingale: The type of martingale betting function used for
        computing the martingale score. Available options are {``Power``,
        ``Mixture``}.

    :param power_martingale_epsilon: The epsilon parameter for the Power
        martingale if martingale is set to ``Power``.
