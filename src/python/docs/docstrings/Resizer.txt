    Resizers an image to a specified dimension using a specified
    resizing method.

    .. remarks::
        ``Resizer`` resizers an image to the specified height and width
        using a specified resizing method. The input variables to this
        transforms must
        be images, typically the result of the ``Loader`` transform.

    :param columns: a dictionary of key-value pairs, where key is the output
        column name and value is the input column name.

        * Multiple key-value pairs are allowed.
        * Input column type: :ref:`Picture`.
        * Output column type: :ref:`Picture`.
        * If the output column names are same as the input column names, then
        simply specify ``columns`` as a list of strings.

        The << operator can be used to set this value (see
        `Column Operator </nimbusml/concepts/columns>`_)

        For example
         * Resizer(columns={'out1':'input1', 'out2':'input2'})
         * Resizer() << {'out1':'input1', 'out2':'input2'}

        For more details see `Columns </nimbusml/concepts/columns>`_.

    :param image_width: Specifies the width of the scaled image in pixels.
        The default value is 224.

    :param image_height: Specifies the height of the scaled image in pixels.
        The default value is 224.

    :param resizing: Specified the resizing method to use. Note that all
        methods
        are using bilinear interpolation. The options are:

        * ``"IsoPad"``: The image is resizerd such that the aspect ratio is
        preserved.
          If needed, the image is padded with black to fit the new width or
        height.
        * ``"IsoCrop"``: The image is resizerd such that the aspect ratio is
        preserved.
          If needed, the image is cropped to fit the new width or height.
        * ``"Aniso"``: The image is stretched to the new width and height,
        without
          preserving the aspect ratio.

        The default value is ``"IsoCrop"``.
