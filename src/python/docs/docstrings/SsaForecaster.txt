    This transform forecasts using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA).

    .. remarks::

        This class implements the transform based on `Singular Spectrum Analysis
        (SSA)<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_spectrum_analysis>`_.
        SSA is a powerful framework for decomposing the time-series into trend,
        seasonality and noise components as well as forecasting the future values
        of the time-series. In principle, SSA performs spectral analysis on the
        input time-series where each component in the spectrum corresponds to a
        trend, seasonal or noise component in the time-series. For details of the
        Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), refer to `this document
        <http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.6910.pdf>`_.
