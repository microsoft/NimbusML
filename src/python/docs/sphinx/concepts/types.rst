Column Types
------------

``nimbusml`` wraps a library written in C#, which is a strongly typed language. Columns of the input data sources are ascribed a type, which is used by
transforms and trainers to decide if they can operate on that column. Some transforms may only allow
text data types, while others only numeric. Trainers almost exclusively require the features and
labels to be of a numeric type.

*Type* is one of the following:

* **TX** : text
* **BL** : boolean
* **R4, R8** : single and double precision floating-point
* **I1, I2, I4, I8** : signed integer types with the indicated number of bytes
* **U1, U2, U4, U8, U256** : unsigned integer types with the indicated number of bytes
* **U4[100-199]** : A key type based on U4 representing legal values from 100 to 199, inclusive
* **V<R4,3,2>** A :ref:`VectorDataViewType` with item type R4 and dimensionality information [3,2]

.. _VectorType:

VectorDataViewType Columns
""""""""""""""""""

A VectorDataViewType column contains a vector of values of a homogenous type, and is associated with a
``column_name``.

The following table shows how ``nimbusml`` processes a dataset:

.. image:: ../_static/images/table_car.png
The third column is a VectorDataViewType column named *Features* with 10 ``slots``. A VectorDataViewType column can
be referenced within a transform (or estimator) by its ``column_name``, such as using *Feature*. But
the ``slots`` themselves may also have names which are generated dynamically by the transform during
the ``fit()`` method. As the return type of all of the transforms is a ``pandas.DataFrame``, a
VectorDataViewType column will be converted. The ``column_name`` of the vector is lost, but the slot names
are preserved (and available for viewing). In the above example, the *Features* column may be
converted to 10 columns with names *Features.0*, *Features.1*,...,*Features.9* as the output of a
transform. However, within a :py:class:`nimbusml.Pipeline` , there is no conversion to a
dataframe and therefore the column_name can still be used to refer to the VectorDataViewType column.

.. note::

    Transforms frequently output VectorDataViewType columns. Within an
    :py:class:`nimbusml.Pipeline`, data transfer between transforms is done very
    efficiently without any conversion to a dataframe. Since the ``column_name`` of the vector is
    also preserved, it is possible to refer to it by downstream transforms by name. However, when
    transforms are used inside a `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline()
    <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html>`_, the output
    of every transform is converted to a ``pandas.DataFrame`` first where the names of ``slots`` are
    preserved, but the ``column_name`` of the vector is dropped.


.. _KeyType:

KeyType Columns
"""""""""""""""

KeyType columns are categorical columns, which use unsigned integers to represent distinct
values of the column. Some properties of KeyType columns are:

* Values are stored in unsigned integers
* Missing key value is stored at 0
* Non-missing key values start from 1

KeyTypes are typically generated from transforms, like the [``ToKey``](xref:nimbusml.preprocessing.ToKey) transform. However, they
may also be specified by the user via a :ref:`schema`. If they are user-specified, then a valid
range must be specified.

For example if a column is specified as

::

    U1[4000-4002]

and the data observed from the :ref:`datasources` contains these values

::

   4000
   4003
   4002
   4001

then the invalid value 4003 will be interpreted as a missing value

::

   4000
   <?>
   4002
   4001
