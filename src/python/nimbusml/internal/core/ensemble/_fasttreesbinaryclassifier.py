    Machine Learning Fast Tree

    .. remarks::
        FastTreesBinaryClassifier is an implementation of FastRank. FastRank
        is
        an efficient implementation of the MART gradient boosting algorithm.
        Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression
        problems. It builds each regression tree in a step-wise fashion,
        using a
        predefined loss function to measure the error for each step and
        corrects
        for it in the next. So this prediction model is actually an ensemble
        of
        weaker prediction models. In regression problems, boosting builds a
        series of of such trees in a step-wise fashion and then selects the
        optimal tree using an arbitrary differentiable loss function.

        MART learns an ensemble of regression trees, which is a decision tree
        with scalar values in its leaves. A decision (or regression) tree is
        a
        binary tree-like flow chart, where at each interior node one decides
        which of the two child nodes to continue to based on one of the
        feature
        values from the input. At each leaf node, a value is returned. In the
        interior nodes, the decision is based on the test ``"x <= v"``, where
        ``x`` is the value of the feature in the input sample and ``v`` is
        one
        of the possible values of this feature. The functions that can be
        produced by a regression tree are all the piece-wise constant
        functions.

        The ensemble of trees is produced by computing, in each step, a
        regression tree that approximates the gradient of the loss function,
        and
        adding it to the previous tree with coefficients that minimize the
        loss
        of the new tree. The output of the ensemble produced by MART on a
        given
        instance is the sum of the tree outputs.

        * In case of a binary classification problem, the output is converted
        to
          a probability by using some form of calibration.
        * In case of a regression problem, the output is the predicted value
        of
          the function.
        * In case of a ranking problem, the instances are ordered by the
        output
          value of the ensemble.

    :param number_of_trees: Specifies the total number of decision trees to
        create in the ensemble. By creating more decision trees, you can
        potentially get better coverage, but the training time increases.

    :param number_of_leaves: The maximum number of leaves (terminal nodes) that
        can be created in any tree. Higher values potentially increase the size
        of the tree and get better precision, but risk overfitting and
        requiring longer training times.

    :param minimum_example_count_per_leaf: Minimum number of training instances
        required to form a leaf. That is, the minimal number of documents
        allowed in a leaf of regression tree, out of the sub-sampled data. A
        'split' means that features in each level of the tree (node) are
        randomly divided.

    :param learning_rate: Determines the size of the step taken in the
        direction of the gradient in each step of the learning process.  This
        determines how fast or slow the learner converges on the optimal
        solution. If the step size is too big, you might overshoot the optimal
        solution.  If the step size is too small, training takes longer to
        converge to the best solution.

    :param normalize: If ``Auto``, the choice to normalize depends on the
        preference declared by the algorithm. This is the default choice. If
        ``No``, no normalization is performed. If ``Yes``, normalization always
        performed. If ``Warn``, if normalization is needed by the algorithm, a
        warning message is displayed but normalization is not performed. If
        normalization is performed, a ``MaxMin`` normalizer is used. This
        normalizer preserves sparsity by mapping zero to zero.

    :param caching: Whether trainer should cache input training data.

    :param unbalanced_sets: Option for using derivatives optimized for
        unbalanced sets.

    :param best_step_trees: Option for using best regression step trees.

    :param early_stopping_rule: Early stopping rule. (Validation set (/valid)
        is required.).

    :param early_stopping_metrics: Early stopping metrics. (For regression, 1:
        L1, 2:L2; for ranking, 1:NDCG@1, 3:NDCG@3).

    :param enable_pruning: Enable post-training pruning to avoid overfitting.
        (a validation set is required).

    :param use_tolerant_pruning: Use window and tolerance for pruning.

    :param pruning_threshold: The tolerance threshold for pruning.

    :param pruning_window_size: The moving window size for pruning.

    :param get_derivatives_sample_rate: Sample each query 1 in k times in the
        GetDerivatives function.

    :param write_last_ensemble: Write the last ensemble instead of the one
        determined by early stopping.

    :param maximum_tree_output: Upper bound on absolute value of single tree
        output.

    :param random_start: Training starts from random ordering (determined by
        /r1).

    :param filter_zero_lambdas: Filter zero lambdas during training.

    :param baseline_scores_formula: Freeform defining the scores that should be
        used as the baseline ranker.

        normal training).

    :param position_discount_freeform: The discount freeform which specifies
        the per position discounts of examples in a query (uses a single
        variable P for position where P=0 is first position).

    :param parallel_trainer: Allows to choose Parallel FastTree Learning
        Algorithm.

    :param number_of_threads: The number of threads to use.

        representation.

    :param first_use_penalty: The feature first use penalty coefficient. This
        is a form of regularization that incurs a penalty for using a new
        feature when creating the tree. Increase this value to create trees
        that don't use many features.
