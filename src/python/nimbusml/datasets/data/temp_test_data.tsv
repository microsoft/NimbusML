1	What a joker you are. European parliament has no power to do anything. It is non binding because it is not serious and silly reports like that are not meant to be serious. what is more important is that we ruled your ancestors for centuries and trying to put negative images of turks in the turkey page is not going to change that. This is not a place for you to get your 'revenge'. Go and edit the golden dawn wikipedia because your ideas will only be welcome there.
