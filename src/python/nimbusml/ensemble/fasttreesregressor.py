    Machine Learning Fast Tree

    .. remarks::
        FastTreesRegressor is an implementation of FastRank. FastRank is an
        efficient
        implementation of the MART gradient boosting algorithm. Gradient
        boosting is
        a machine learning technique for regression problems. It builds each
        regression tree in a step-wise fashion, using a predefined loss
        function to
        measure the error for each step and corrects for it in the next. So
        this
        prediction model is actually an ensemble of weaker prediction models.
        In
        regression problems, boosting builds a series of of such trees in a
        step-wise
        fashion and then selects the optimal tree using an arbitrary
        differentiable
        loss function.

        MART learns an ensemble of regression trees, which is a decision tree
        with
        scalar values in its leaves. A decision (or regression) tree is a
        binary tree-like flow chart, where at each interior node one decides
        which
        of the two child nodes to continue to based on one of the feature
        values
        from the input. At each leaf node, a value is returned. In the
        interior nodes, the decision is based on the test ``"x <= v"``, where
        ``x`` is the value of the feature in the input sample and ``v`` is
        one
        of the possible values of this feature. The functions that can be
        produced
        by a regression tree are all the piece-wise constant functions.

        The ensemble of trees is produced by computing, in each step, a
        regression
        tree that approximates the gradient of the loss function, and adding
        it to
        the previous tree with coefficients that minimize the loss of the new
        tree.
        The output of the ensemble produced by MART on a given instance is
        the sum
        of the tree outputs.

        * In case of a binary classification problem, the output is converted
        to
          a probability by using some form of calibration.
        * In case of a regression problem, the output is the predicted value
        of
          the function.
        * In case of a ranking problem, the instances are ordered by the
        output value of
          the ensemble.

    :param feature: see `Columns </nimbusml/concepts/columns>`_.

    :param group_id: see `Columns </nimbusml/concepts/columns>`_.

    :param label: see `Columns </nimbusml/concepts/columns>`_.

    :param weight: see `Columns </nimbusml/concepts/columns>`_.

    :param num_trees: Specifies the total number of decision trees to create in
        the ensemble. By creating more decision trees, you can potentially get
        better coverage, but the training time increases.

    :param num_leaves: The maximum number of leaves (terminal nodes) that can
        be created in any tree. Higher values potentially increase the size of
        the tree and get better precision, but risk overfitting and requiring
        longer training times.

    :param min_split: Minimum number of training instances required to form a
        leaf. That is, the minimal number of documents allowed in a leaf of
        regression tree, out of the sub-sampled data. A 'split' means that
        features in each level of the tree (node) are randomly divided.

    :param learning_rate: Determines the size of the step taken in the
        direction of the gradient in each step of the learning process.  This
        determines how fast or slow the learner converges on the optimal
        solution. If the step size is too big, you might overshoot the optimal
        solution.  If the step size is too small, training takes longer to
        converge to the best solution.

    :param normalize: If ``Auto``, the choice to normalize depends on the
        preference declared by the algorithm. This is the default choice. If
        ``No``, no normalization is performed. If ``Yes``, normalization always
        performed. If ``Warn``, if normalization is needed by the algorithm, a
        warning message is displayed but normalization is not performed. If
        normalization is performed, a ``MaxMin`` normalizer is used. This
        normalizer preserves sparsity by mapping zero to zero.

    :param caching: Whether learner should cache input training data.

    :param best_step_trees: Use best regression step trees?.

    :param use_line_search: Should we use line search for a step size.

    :param optimizer: Default is ``sgd``.

    :param early_stopping_rule: Early stopping rule. (Validation set (/valid)
        is required.).

    :param early_stopping_metrics: Early stopping metrics. (For regression, 1:
        L1, 2:L2; for ranking, 1:NDCG@1, 3:NDCG@3).

    :param enable_pruning: Enable post-training pruning to avoid overfitting.
        (a validation set is required).

    :param use_tolerant_pruning: Use window and tolerance for pruning.

    :param pruning_threshold: The tolerance threshold for pruning.

    :param pruning_window_size: The moving window size for pruning.

    :param shrinkage: Shrinkage.

    :param dropout_rate: Dropout rate for tree regularization.

    :param get_derivatives_sample_rate: Sample each query 1 in k times in the
        GetDerivatives function.

    :param write_last_ensemble: Write the last ensemble instead of the one
        determined by early stopping.

    :param max_tree_output: Upper bound on absolute value of single tree
        output.

    :param random_start: Training starts from random ordering (determined by
        /r1).

    :param filter_zero_lambdas: Filter zero lambdas during training.

    :param baseline_scores_formula: Freeform defining the scores that should be
        used as the baseline ranker.

    :param baseline_alpha_risk: Baseline alpha for tradeoffs of risk (0 is
        normal training).

    :param position_discount_freeform: The discount freeform which specifies
        the per position discounts of documents in a query (uses a single
        variable P for position where P=0 is first position).

    :param parallel_trainer: Allows to choose Parallel FastTree Learning
        Algorithm.

    :param train_threads: The number of threads to use.

    :param random_state: The seed of the random number generator.

        between 0 and 1.

    :param histogram_pool_size: The number of histograms in the pool (between 2
        and numLeaves).

    :param disk_transpose: Whether to utilize the disk or the data's native
        transposition facilities (where applicable) when performing the
        transpose.

    :param feature_flocks: Whether to collectivize features during dataset
        preparation to speed up training.

        feature values.

    :param max_categorical_groups_per_node: Maximum categorical split groups to
        consider when splitting on a categorical feature. Split groups are a

        there many categorical features.

        consider when splitting on a categorical feature.

        feature when creating the tree. Increase this value to create trees
        that don't use many features.

    :param feature_reuse_penalty: The feature re-use penalty (regularization)
        coefficient.

    :param gain_conf_level: Tree fitting gain confidence requirement (should be
