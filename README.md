# NimbusML

`nimbusml` is a Python module that provides experimental Python bindings for [ML.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning). 

ML.NET was originally developed in Microsoft Research and is used across many product groups in Microsoft like Windows, Bing, PowerPoint, Excel and others. `nimbusml` was built to enable data science teams that are more familiar with Python to take advantage of ML.NET's functionality and performance. 

This package enables training ML.NET pipelines or integrating ML.NET components directly into [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) pipelines (it supports  `numpy.ndarray`, `scipy.sparse_cst`, and `pandas.DataFrame` as inputs).

Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/NimbusML/overview) and additional notebook samples can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/NimbusML-Samples).

## Installation

`nimbusml` runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

`nimbusml` requires Python **2.7**, **3.5**, **3.6**, **3.7** 64 bit version only.

Install `nimbusml` using `pip` with:

```
pip install nimbusml
```

`nimbusml` has been reported to work on Windows 10, MacOS 10.13, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04, CentOS 7, and RHEL 7.

## Examples

Here is an example of how to train a model to predict sentiment from text samples (based on [this](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/README.md) ML.NET example). The full code for this example is [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/NimbusML-Samples/blob/master/samples/2.1%20%5BText%5D%20Sentiment%20Analysis%201%20-%20Data%20Loading%20with%20Pandas.ipynb).

```python
from nimbusml import Pipeline, FileDataStream
from nimbusml.datasets import get_dataset
from nimbusml.ensemble import FastTreesBinaryClassifier
from nimbusml.feature_extraction.text import NGramFeaturizer

train_file = get_dataset('gen_twittertrain').as_filepath()
test_file = get_dataset('gen_twittertest').as_filepath()

train_data = FileDataStream.read_csv(train_file, sep='\t')
test_data = FileDataStream.read_csv(test_file, sep='\t')

pipeline = Pipeline([ # nimbusml pipeline
    NGramFeaturizer(columns={'Features': ['Text']}),
    FastTreesBinaryClassifier(feature=['Features'], label='Label')
])

# fit and predict
pipeline.fit(train_data)
results = pipeline.predict(test_data)
```

Instead of creating an `nimbusml` pipeline, you can also integrate components into scikit-learn pipelines:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from nimbusml.datasets import get_dataset
from nimbusml.ensemble import FastTreesBinaryClassifier
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import pandas as pd

train_file = get_dataset('gen_twittertrain').as_filepath()
test_file = get_dataset('gen_twittertest').as_filepath()

train_data = pd.read_csv(train_file, sep='\t')
test_data = pd.read_csv(test_file, sep='\t')

pipeline = Pipeline([ # sklearn pipeline
    ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer()), # sklearn transform
    ('clf', FastTreesBinaryClassifier()) # nimbusml learner
])

# fit and predict
pipeline.fit(train_data["Text"], train_data["Label"])
results = pipeline.predict(test_data["Text"])
```
